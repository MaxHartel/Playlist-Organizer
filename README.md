# Playlist-Organizer

## Overview

This java application produces a play list sorted by song run time, an average song runtime for the play list, indicates which song is the closest to 4 minutes long, and formats the output in an easy to read way

## Reflection

There were parts of this that were very challenging, such as figuring out how to display the songs in order of which ones had the shortest runtime. I also had trouble using the song class at first, but that wasn't too bad. I really enjoyed how this project really made me think. I liked how it made me think in both a logical and creative way at the same time. For example I liked how I had to be creative to come up with ways to solve problems, then I had to think logically in order to implement my solution. I would like to understand loops better, as I feel this project could have gone faster If I had used them.
## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac PlayList.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java PlayList
```

You will be prompted for Song Titles, Song artists, The album the song is in, and the runtime of the song.
